# Open Design for Drupal

Join us at Telegram: telegram.me/drupalindia

Welcome to the Open Design-Drupal Repo. Open Design aims to bring open source principles to Creative Design. Here you can file issues with your design requests for the community design group, find collaborators, or find design tasks to tackle. Don't forget to use the issue template below to make sure you are including all the relevant information!

Anyone can take (or make) a design issue, as long as it is related to Drupal!

NOTE: Once you've completed a project please include the source files!
